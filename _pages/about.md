I am an innovative and detail-oriented **Software Engineer in Test**, specializing in desktop applications. Previously at MathWorks, I supported my product team which develops software features to enable integration of customers hand-written custom C and C++ code into Simulink models. The custom code integration facilitates engineers in leveraging and testing their algorithms. My day-to-day work involves developing test cases and writing automated tests to qualify software features. Beyond feature qualification I typically worked on projects within and outside my team to improve the testing process and throughput.

Prior to my time at MathWorks, I completed my doctoral degree in **Robotics Engineering** at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). For my dissertation work I developed a soft continuum robot which takes inspiration from elephant trunks and octopus arms. The research work encompassed both hardware and software development. Hardware development work included: fabricating bendable origami structures (made out of plastic sheet) for continuum modules, and developing a custom printed circuit board (PCB) for actuator/motor control and sensor reading. On the software side, I wrote low-level C code for motor control and sensor reading, as well as MATLAB code for high-level control and motion planning algorithms. For more details on the work please refer to this [journal paper](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/soro.2020.0026) or my [dissertation](https://digital.wpi.edu/concern/parent/dz010s164/file_sets/z890rw581). My work was also featured in the [WPI's news post](https://www.wpi.edu/news/wpi-researchers-develop-robotic-arm-wheelchairs). Prior to graduation, I had the opportunity to complete industry internships, where I did similar work in designing a custom controller board and an electro-mechanical device.

Outside of work, I am a **Board Game Aficionado**, though I am relatively new to the hobby. I enjoy games with simple rules but deep strategic decision-making. With that said I am currently working on a pet project to replicate the AlphaGo AI based on this [book](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-and-the-game-of-go) and see if I can extend it for other games with perfect information. It will be a great and fun learning opportunity, but of course, nothing beats playing with other people.
